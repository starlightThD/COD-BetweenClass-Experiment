WARNING: [Project 1-498] One or more constraints failed evaluation while reading constraint file [C:/Users/ThD/Desktop/资料系列/icf.xdc] and the design contains unresolved black boxes. These constraints will be read post-synthesis (as long as their source constraint file is marked as used_in_implementation) and should be applied correctly then. You should review the constraints listed in the file [.Xil/SCPU_TOP_propImpl.xdc] and check the run log file to verify that these constraints were correctly applied.
INFO: [Project 1-236] Implementation specific constraints were found while reading constraint file [C:/Users/ThD/Desktop/资料系列/icf.xdc]. These constraints will be ignored for synthesis but will be used in implementation. Impacted constraints are listed in the file [.Xil/SCPU_TOP_propImpl.xdc].
Resolution: To avoid this warning, move constraints listed in [.Xil/SCPU_TOP_propImpl.xdc] to another XDC file and exclude this new file from synthesis with the used_in_synthesis property (File Properties dialog in GUI) and re-run elaboration/synthesis.

Resolution: This message can indicate that there are no constraints for the design, or it can indicate that the used_in flags are set such that the constraints are ignored. This later case is used when running synth_design to not write synthesis constraints to the resulting checkpoint. Instead, project constraints are read when the synthesized design is opened.
